## Part 2 — Conventional Arm: Written Questions (ported from KOSEN68, Q1/Q4/Q5/Q6)

Answer each in your own words (4–8 sentences, more where the question asks for a design).
This is a normal written/essay task — no AI-resilience layer applies to this part; answer it
yourself.

**Q1. Weak Stateless Cookie Design (Hash-only Cookie).** A web server stores:
`cookie = username || SHA-3(username)`. Analyze why this design fails to provide authenticity
and integrity. If an attacker modifies `username=bob` to `username=admin`, explain why the
server cannot detect tampering.

**Q4. Timing Attack on Tag Verification.** A server verifies a MAC with:
```python
if received_tag == computed_tag:
    accept()
else:
    reject()
```
Explain why this is vulnerable to timing attacks, how an attacker recovers the tag byte-by-byte
via response times, and why constant-time comparison is required.

**Q5. SHA-256 Length-Extension Attack.** `MAC = SHA-256(key || message)`,
`message = "user=bob"`. An attacker wants to append `&admin=true`. Explain how the attacker
computes a valid new MAC without knowing the key, why SHA-256's Merkle-Damgard design enables
this, and why HMAC is not vulnerable.

**Q6. Designing a Secure Cookie Using MAC.** Design a secure cookie system preventing tampering
and replay. Your answer must state: the fields stored, how the MAC is computed, how
verification works, a replay-prevention mechanism, and why this is safer than hashing
`key || message`.

## Part 3 — AIR-Sec Arm: Hands-on Lab (180 min)

**Learning goals:** exploit a secret-prefix hash MAC via length-extension, then verify HMAC
closes the gap — the *practical* twin of Part 2's Q5.
**Prerequisites:** Docker; Python 3.12 (or the `requests` package) on the host to run
`exploit.py`.

**Environment setup**
```bash
cd labs/week03-macs
docker compose up -d        # vulnerable_app.py on :8092, fixed_app.py on :8093
curl localhost:8092/        # confirm it's up
```

**Task 0 — Onboarding (10 min).** *Goal:* see the vulnerable construction. *Steps:* read
`vulnerable_app.py`'s `make_cookie`/`admin` functions; identify exactly which line computes the
signature and confirm it is `SHA256(MAC_SECRET + data)`, not HMAC. *Deliverable:* quote the
line and state which of Q1/Q5's failure mode it matches.

**Task 1 — Capture a legitimate cookie (10 min).** *Goal:* get a real `(data, sig)` pair.
*Steps:* `curl -i "localhost:8092/login?user=guest"`; record the `data` and `sig` cookies.
*Deliverable:* the two cookie values + the decoded (from-hex) plaintext of `data`.

**Task 2 — Run the length-extension forgery (30 min).** *Goal:* understand *and* reproduce the
attack, not just run a script. *Steps:* read `exploit.py`'s `sha256_padding` and
`length_extend` functions; on paper (or in your write-up), compute the glue-padding length for
`len(MAC_SECRET) + len(data) = 16 + 22 = 38` bytes by hand using the SHA-256 padding rule
(append `0x80`, then zero bytes until length ≡ 56 mod 64, then an 8-byte big-endian bit-length).
Then run `python exploit.py` and confirm your hand-computed padding length matches the glue
bytes it printed. *Deliverable:* your hand computation + the script's forged `data`/`sig`.

**Task 3 — Cash in the flag (10 min).** *Goal:* confirm the forged cookie is accepted.
*Steps:* `exploit.py` already does this (`GET /admin` on `:8092` with the forged cookie); note
the flag it printed. Also manually reproduce it with `curl` (`--cookie "data=...;sig=..."`) to
convince yourself the script isn't doing anything hidden. *Deliverable:* the flag + your `curl`
command and its output.

**Task 4 — Confirm HMAC rejects the same trick (15 min).** *Goal:* prove the fix works, not
just claim it. *Steps:* `exploit.py` repeats the identical forgery technique against `:8093`
(`fixed_app.py`, HMAC); confirm it printed `403`/rejected. Read `fixed_app.py`'s `make_cookie`
and identify the one-line change from `vulnerable_app.py`. *Deliverable:* the rejection
evidence + the diff (in words) between the two `make_cookie` functions.

**Task 5 — Explain why, precisely (20 min).** *Goal:* connect the exploit to the theory.
*Steps:* answer in your own words: (a) What internal SHA-256 state does `sig` actually expose
to the attacker? (b) Why does resuming compression from that state let the attacker compute
`H(secret || data || glue || extra)` without `secret`? (c) Why does HMAC's outer hash
`H(key⊕opad || H(key⊕ipad || message))` NOT expose an equivalently resumable state? *Deliverable:*
3 short paragraphs, one per sub-question.

## Evidence & Integrity (required)

- **Identity proof:** your terminal/screenshot evidence for Tasks 1–4 must show a terminal
  running `printf '%s | %s | ' "$(whoami)" '<YOUR-STUDENT-ID>'; date '+%F %T %Z'` **in the same image as the evidence**. When the evidence is a browser page,
  a DevTools panel or a rendered response, put that terminal **beside the browser and capture
  the whole screen** — a cropped window carries nothing that identifies you, and the lab's own
  output is byte-identical for the whole cohort *by design*, so the stamp is the only thing
  that makes the shot yours.
- **Personalized flag:** ____________________
  *Flags are unique per student (via `MAC_SECRET`/`FLAG_MACS` env override — see README) —
  submitting another student's flag is a violation.*
- **Explain in your own words** *(graded on your reasoning, not copied text):*
  1. What did you do, and **why did the forgery work**?
  2. **Why does the HMAC fix actually stop it** — and what could still break it (e.g. is the
     `!=` comparison in `fixed_app.py`'s `/admin` still a timing-attack risk)?

## 🤖 Audit the AI (required)

AI is a power tool you must **distrust** — you are graded on your *critique*, not the AI's
answer.

Below is an AI assistant's answer to **Q6** (design a secure cookie using a MAC). It looks
professional and uses correct terminology, but it has **at least one subtly serious flaw**.
Your job: find it.

> **AI's answer to Q6:**
>
> "Design: the cookie stores three fields, joined with `|`: `user_id`, `issued_at` (Unix
> timestamp), and `role`. The server computes
> `tag = HMAC-SHA256(server_key, f"{user_id}|{issued_at}|{role}")` and sends the client
> `cookie = f"{user_id}|{issued_at}|{role}|{tag}"`.
>
> Verification: on each request, the server splits the cookie on `|`, recomputes
> `HMAC-SHA256(server_key, f"{user_id}|{issued_at}|{role}")`, and compares it to the received
> `tag` using Python's `==` operator. If they match, the request is accepted as authentic and
> the timestamp is logged for audit purposes.
>
> Replay prevention: because `issued_at` is embedded in the MAC'd data, any attempt to change
> it invalidates the tag, so an attacker cannot forge a *new* timestamp. This closes the replay
> window described in Q3, since old cookies are cryptographically bound to their original
> issue time.
>
> Why this is safer than hashing `key || message`: HMAC's nested construction means the
> internal hash state is never directly exposed to the attacker the way a naive
> `SHA256(key || message)` construction is, so length-extension does not apply. Additionally,
> since `issued_at` is part of the signed data, the server can always tell precisely when a
> cookie was issued."
>
> — end of AI answer —

1. **Find what's wrong or risky in it.** Quote the exact sentence(s). (Hint: the HMAC
   reasoning and the length-extension immunity claim are both *correct* — don't waste your
   critique there. Look at what "replay prevention" actually *guarantees* versus what the
   server *does* with `issued_at`, and separately at the comparison operator used in
   verification.)
2. **Produce the correct, verified version yourself.** Rewrite the two flawed parts of the
   design (not the whole answer) and explain in 2–3 sentences why the AI's version was
   insufficient even though the cookie *would pass its own described verification step*.

> Disclose your AI use (if any, beyond this provided artifact) in the Part 1 table. This task
> counts toward the **Audit the AI** row of the grading rubric.

## 🧠 Comprehension & Prompt (required)

**A. Explain in Plain English (EiPE).** Explain SHA-256 length-extension to a junior developer
who has never heard the term "Merkle-Damgard" and does not have a cryptography background. In
2–4 sentences: what can the attacker do, and *why* does hashing a secret and a message together
(with the secret first) not protect the message the way the developer probably assumed it
would? Avoid restating jargon (don't just say "Merkle-Damgard" back at them) — explain the
*mechanism* in terms of "the hash function processes data in chunks and remembers where it left
off."

**B. Prompt Problem.** Write a **single prompt** that asks an AI to explain *why HMAC resists
length-extension attacks while a bare `SHA256(key||message)` does not*. Run it, then critique
the AI's answer:
- Does it correctly distinguish the *inner* hash from the *outer* hash in HMAC's construction?
- Does it explain what would need to be true for an attacker to extend the *outer* hash (i.e.
  why they'd need to know `H(key⊕ipad || message)`'s state *and* still can't get anywhere
  because the outer hash re-keys with `key⊕opad`)?
- Does it hallucinate anything (a wrong RFC number, a wrong claim about SHA-3/Keccak also being
  vulnerable to the same attack — SHA-3's sponge construction is *not* vulnerable to classic
  length-extension, unlike SHA-256)?

Submit the **final prompt + the AI's answer + your critique** (3–5 sentences covering the three
bullet points above).

## 🎤 Viva spot-check (instructor use — 3 questions)

An instructor may ask any of these live, at random, to confirm you did the work yourself:

1. "Your forged `data` field is longer than the original — show me on your printed hex dump
   exactly which bytes are the SHA-256 glue padding, and explain why the byte right after
   `admin=false` is always `0x80`."
2. "If I doubled `MAC_SECRET`'s length but didn't tell you, what in your exploit would you have
   to change, and what would happen if you got that number wrong?"
3. "Point to the one line that differs between `vulnerable_app.py`'s and `fixed_app.py`'s
   `make_cookie` function, and explain in one sentence why that line alone defeats
   length-extension."

## Part 5 — Appendix / Future Exam-Bank Material (KOSEN68 Q2, Q3, Q7–Q10)

Not assigned this week; kept here for a future exam item bank per the course's exam-bank
convention (see `course-plan-19weeks.md`).

**Q2. Short Authentication Tag in IoT (64-bit MAC).** Using the birthday bound, estimate how
many MAC outputs an attacker needs to find a collision; evaluate whether a 64-bit MAC is secure
against forgery; explain the risks of a short tag in critical infrastructure (e.g. grid
controllers).

**Q3. Replay Attack in a MAC-Only System.** `tag = MAC(k, message)`, no counter/timestamp/nonce.
An attacker replays an intercepted "Transfer 1000 THB" message+tag later. Explain why MACs
alone do not prevent replay attacks and describe a secure defense.

**Q7. Choosing Between HMAC and KMAC** for: a legacy SHA-2 system; a system needing inherent
length-extension immunity; variable-length MAC output; constrained IoT devices.

**Q8. Key Rotation Strategy.** Analyze rotating every 1 hour / every 1000 messages / near
counter overflow (2^64) / never — impact on security, performance, complexity.

**Q9. Designing a Secure Messaging Protocol Using MAC (A→B).** Cover integrity, authenticity,
replay protection, multi-device support, offline queue handling — show message structure +
verification flow.

**Q10. Using MACs for Hash Table Integrity.** How a MAC alongside stored values protects
against tampering; whether hash collisions can bypass MAC checks; integrity vs. structural
security.
