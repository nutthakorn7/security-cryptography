# Week 14 — User Authentication: The Server Sees Your Password (Unless It Can't)

**Topic (course-plan):** User Authentication · **Kind:** HYBRID
**Concepts:** password submission vs. challenge-response / PAKE, verifier storage, authentication
factors, TOTP vs. FIDO2, credential stuffing, delegated authentication (SSO/OAuth) ·
**Analogous CWE:** CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission
of Sensitive Information — *to the endpoint*, even when the wire itself is TLS), CWE-532 (Insertion
of Sensitive Information into Log File)

## This week — what to do
1. **Before class** — Docker Desktop working (same Docker-first setup as `software-security` and
   this course's earlier weeks); skim the Week 2 password-hashing recap (you will reuse "store a
   verifier, never the password").
2. **Lecture (120 min)** — weekly quiz first (~10 min), then the lecture: why "log in by sending
   your password" hands the plaintext to the *server*, and what a challenge-response / PAKE buys
   you. Slides: `slides/week14.md` *(not yet written — see `course-plan-19weeks.md`)*.
3. **Lab (180 min)** — run the demo in both modes below, then complete **Worksheet 14**
   (`worksheet.md`, Part 1 — Conventional essays; Part 2 — AIR-Sec arm: lab evidence, Audit-the-AI,
   EiPE, Prompt Problem, viva prep).
4. **Submit** — worksheet PDF + captured log evidence → Classroom · code unchanged (this is a
   read/run/observe lab, not an exploit-and-fix-the-code lab) → GitHub. (How: [SUBMISSION.md](../../SUBMISSION.md).)

## Objectives
- Explain why sending a password to the server is a risk **even over TLS** — TLS protects the
  *wire*, but the server *terminates* the TLS and therefore holds your plaintext password; a
  malicious, compromised, or merely over-logging server harvests it.
- **Execute and observe** the difference: in plain-password mode the server logs
  `SERVER SAW PASSWORD: correct-horse-battery`; in challenge-response mode the server logs only a
  nonce and a proof (`SERVER SAW: nonce=... proof=...`) and the password appears **nowhere**, yet
  the client still authenticates (`LOGIN OK`).
- Explain what a challenge-response protocol proves (knowledge of the password) *without*
  transmitting the password, and how the server verifies it from a stored verifier `v = KDF(salt,
  password)` it derived without ever needing to keep the plaintext.
- Distinguish the three authentication factors (know / have / are) and reason about TOTP,
  FIDO2/WebAuthn, credential stuffing, and delegated authentication (SSO/OAuth) — the conceptual
  half of this HYBRID week (Part 1 essays + Part 2 EiPE).
- **Understand the honest limits of this demo** (see the box below): the fixed side proves only
  *"password never transmitted."* It is **not** a full PAKE.

## 🗝️ Signature game — "Never Say the Password"
Play server operator and catch your own login system handing you the plaintext password on a
silver platter, sitting right there in your logs. Then flip on challenge-response and log in
successfully **without the password ever crossing the wire at all** — prove it by grepping your
own logs for it and finding nothing.

**Why it's exciting:** proving you know a secret without ever saying it out loud feels like a
magic trick the first time it clicks — and it's the same trick every "Sign in with..." button
quietly relies on.

## How this maps to the concept

Two services, one network:

| Service | Role | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `server.py` | Flask auth server | Listens on `:8080`. Behaviour set by env var `PAKE`. **Vulnerable** (`PAKE` unset): `POST /login {username, password}` — receives the plaintext password, **logs it** (`SERVER SAW PASSWORD: ...`), checks it. **Fixed** (`PAKE=1`): `GET /challenge` hands out a random nonce; `POST /login {username, nonce, proof}` — the server recomputes the proof from its **stored verifier** and logs only the nonce + proof, **never** the password. |
| `client.py` | Login client | Runs the flow that matches the mode and prints `LOGIN OK` on success. **Vulnerable:** puts the actual password in the request body. **Fixed:** fetches the nonce, derives `verifier = KDF(salt, password)` **locally**, sends `proof = HMAC(verifier, nonce)` — the password never leaves the client. |

The premise: **TLS is not the whole story.** TLS (which this demo omits for clarity — the lesson is
about the *server endpoint*, not the wire) would stop a network eavesdropper from reading the
password in transit. It does **nothing** about the fact that the server on the other end decrypts
the TLS and then holds your plaintext password in a request handler — free to log it, store it,
forward it, or leak it in a breach. Plain-password login trusts the server completely. A
challenge-response protocol removes that trust: the client proves it *knows* the password by
answering a fresh random challenge, and the server checks the answer against a **verifier**
`v = KDF(salt, password)` it can store without ever holding the plaintext. The password is never
transmitted, so a compromised or logging server has nothing to harvest.

> ### Honest scope — this fixed demo is NOT a full PAKE
> The fixed side here demonstrates **exactly one** property: **the password is never transmitted to
> the server.** It is a deliberately simplified challenge-response, chosen so the log evidence is
> unambiguous. A **real PAKE** (SRP, OPAQUE) additionally provides **two** properties this demo does
> **not**:
> 1. **Offline-dictionary resistance on the stored verifier.** Here the verifier is a fast salted
>    SHA-256; if the server's database leaked, an attacker could brute-force weak passwords against
>    it offline. A real PAKE's verifier is constructed so a database leak does not enable an easy
>    offline dictionary attack (and in any real system the KDF would be bcrypt/argon2 with a high
>    work factor — see Week 2).
> 2. **Mutual authentication.** Here only the server checks the client. A real PAKE also lets the
>    client verify it is talking to the genuine server, so it cannot be tricked into proving its
>    password to an impostor.
>
> **Do not present this demo as a complete PAKE.** Its single, real, demonstrable lesson is
> "password never sent" — which is precisely the property the log evidence below proves. Worksheet
> Q4 and Part 2b ask you to reason about the two properties this demo is missing.

## Run it

Vulnerable mode — plain password login, server harvests the plaintext:
```bash
cd labs/week14-authentication
docker compose -f docker-compose.vulnerable.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit
```
Expected log lines (timestamps/IPs vary run to run — the container names and the
`SERVER SAW PASSWORD` / `LOGIN OK` text do not):
```
week14-server  | SERVER: listening on 0.0.0.0:8080 (PAKE=False)
week14-client  | CLIENT: plain-password login to http://server:8080 as 'alice' (PAKE=False)
week14-server  | SERVER SAW PASSWORD: correct-horse-battery
week14-client  | LOGIN OK
```
`client` exits `0` once it authenticates; `server` is a long-running server. With
`--abort-on-container-exit` the stack stops as soon as `client` exits. Tear it down:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.vulnerable.yml down
```

Fixed mode — challenge-response, password never transmitted:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.fixed.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit
```
Expected log lines (the `nonce`/`proof` hex values are random every run):
```
week14-server  | SERVER: listening on 0.0.0.0:8080 (PAKE=True)
week14-client  | CLIENT: challenge-response login to http://server:8080 as 'alice' (PAKE=True)
week14-server  | SERVER SAW: nonce=<32 hex chars> proof=<64 hex chars>
week14-client  | LOGIN OK
```
`client` still exits `0` (`LOGIN OK`) — authentication succeeded — but there is **no**
`SERVER SAW PASSWORD` line anywhere, and the string `correct-horse-battery` appears **nowhere** in
the logs. That absence is your evidence the fix worked. Confirm it explicitly:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.fixed.yml logs | grep -c "correct-horse-battery"   # -> 0
docker compose -f docker-compose.fixed.yml logs | grep -c "SERVER SAW PASSWORD"      # -> 0
```
Tear down the same way:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.fixed.yml down
```

Which compose file you point `-f` at is the **only** thing that selects vulnerable vs. fixed mode
(`PAKE` is baked into each file's `environment:` block for both `server` and `client`). No
environment variables need to be set by hand.

**The captured `SERVER SAW PASSWORD: correct-horse-battery` line (vulnerable mode) — submitted with
your identity proof — is the personalized/attributable evidence artifact for this HYBRID week, in
place of a CTF flag.** The fixed-mode evidence is the *absence* of that line plus the `grep -c`
returning `0`.

## Verified

Both modes were Docker-tested against the actual files in this directory, run fresh from a
scratchpad copy (OneDrive placeholders can break `docker build` COPY in place, so the build was run
from a plain copy), brought up with `--abort-on-container-exit`, and torn down after.

- **Vulnerable:** the run printed `SERVER: listening on 0.0.0.0:8080 (PAKE=False)`,
  `CLIENT: plain-password login ... (PAKE=False)`, `SERVER SAW PASSWORD: correct-horse-battery`,
  and `LOGIN OK`, with `client` exiting `0`. `docker compose -f docker-compose.vulnerable.yml logs
  | grep -c "SERVER SAW PASSWORD: correct-horse-battery"` returned `1` and `grep -c "LOGIN OK"`
  returned `1`.
- **Fixed:** the run printed `SERVER: listening on 0.0.0.0:8080 (PAKE=True)`,
  `CLIENT: challenge-response login ... (PAKE=True)`, a single
  `SERVER SAW: nonce=327decaec7e5d719846da41ed2c55010 proof=40e701177990a639995ceedb524305dacc1dfa6246484327f687426916b65b15`
  line (hex random per run), and `LOGIN OK` — with `client` still exiting `0`.
  `grep -c "correct-horse-battery"` returned **`0`**, `grep -c "SERVER SAW PASSWORD"` returned
  **`0`**, `grep -c "SERVER SAW: nonce="` returned `1`, and `grep -c "LOGIN OK"` returned `1`.
- Both stacks were torn down (`docker compose down`) and their built images removed after
  verification; nothing was left running.

## Deliverable
Worksheet 14 (`worksheet.md`, Parts 1–2), including the captured log evidence from both modes
(Part 2a), the Audit-the-AI finding on the planted login handler (Part 2b), the EiPE explanation
(Part 2c), the Prompt Problem critique (Part 2d), and viva prep (Part 2e).
