# Week 5 — Key Exchanges: MITM Against Unauthenticated Diffie-Hellman

**Topic (KOSEN68 source):** `Week5_Key Exchanges Questions.docx` · **Kind:** HYBRID
**Concepts:** Diffie-Hellman key exchange, active vs. passive attackers, machine-in-the-middle,
public-key authentication, forward secrecy · **Analogous CWE:** CWE-322 (Key Exchange without
Entity Authentication), CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint)

## This week — 100-minute class and assigned assessment

1. **Before class** — Prepare Docker and download the lab files before the contact block. Read the Week 4 recap.
2. **In class (100 minutes)** — 10 quiz/review + 10 brief + 60 shared practice/analysis +
   15 debrief + 5 evidence capture. The opening quiz reviews Week 4; the Week 5 quiz is
   taken at the start of Week 6. Slides: `slides/week05.md`.
3. **Common work (60 points)** — Run both DH topologies. Trace Relay's two independent handshakes, the intercepted message, and both authentication failures. Explain what the HMAC check changes and why fresh DH is still used.
4. **Assigned format (40 points)** — complete **either** four short Conventional questions
   **or** AIR-Sec (Audit the AI 20 + EiPE 10 + Prompt Problem 10). Both versions total 100.
   Viva checks support feedback/authenticity within the criteria; they add no separate marks.
5. **After class** — finish the short explanations and assigned format. The group-validation
   questions are optional study only. Submit the worksheet
   PDF and required evidence according to [SUBMISSION.md](../../SUBMISSION.md). This week
   has no separate code-fix/GitHub submission.

## Objectives
- Explain why Alice and Bob need a *key exchange* rather than simply sending a symmetric key,
  and what an eavesdropper gains if they skip it.
- Trace a full Diffie-Hellman handshake (private exponent → public value → shared secret) and
  explain why the discrete-log problem makes the shared secret hard for an eavesdropper to
  recover.
- **Execute and observe** a full active machine-in-the-middle against unauthenticated DH: two
  independent handshakes, one attacker-controlled shared secret with each side, silent
  decrypt-relog-reencrypt of the traffic in between.
- Explain why authenticating the DH public keys (here: an HMAC under a pre-shared key) defeats
  that MITM, **without** giving up the property DH exists for in the first place (forward
  secrecy of the session key).
- Recognize that input validation is a separate concern; a small-subgroup attack is **not**
  demonstrated or assessed this week.

## 🕵️ Signature game — "The Silent Third Wheel"
Be the eavesdropper who becomes an active puppet-master: sit silently between Alice and Bob,
run your own DH handshake with each of them, and read their "secure" channel in the clear —
they never notice. Then watch a single HMAC tag over the public key shut you out completely,
with no other code change.

**Why it's exciting:** it's the one week where you get to be the invisible third wheel in
someone else's "private" conversation — and then feel exactly how thin that privacy was.

## How this maps to the DH / MITM concept

Three services, three roles, one shared 2048-bit MODP group (RFC3526 Group 14):

| Service | Role | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `bob.py` | Server | Listens on `:5000`, does a DH handshake with whoever connects, decrypts one AES-GCM message, prints `BOB RECEIVED: <plaintext>`. |
| `alice.py` | Client | Connects to `PEER_HOST:PEER_PORT` (`relay`, **never** `bob` directly), does a DH handshake, encrypts a fixed message under the derived key, sends it. |
| `relay.py` | Attacker | Sits on the network path between Alice and Bob. In vulnerable mode it runs **two entirely independent DH handshakes** — one with Alice (posing as Bob), one with Bob (posing as Alice). Alice and Relay share the first secret; Bob and Relay share the second. Relay is the **only party holding both**. It decrypts Alice's message with the Alice-side key, logs it, then re-encrypts the same plaintext under the Bob-side key and forwards it on. |

The premise: **Alice's `PEER_HOST` is `relay`, not `bob`.** That is the whole lesson — over an
unauthenticated network, "whoever answers when I dial Bob's address" is not the same claim as
"Bob." Plain DH gives Alice and Bob a shared secret that no *eavesdropper* can compute (the
discrete-log problem), but it gives neither side any way to check *who* they just agreed that
secret with. An *active* attacker who can intercept and re-originate connections can simply run
the protocol twice and stand in the middle — invisibly, because both handshakes complete
successfully and no independently trusted authentication tag gets checked.

The fix (`SIGNED=1`) does **not** replace DH with sending a symmetric key directly — Alice and
Bob still run a fresh DH exchange every session. If the ephemeral DH secrets are erased,
later disclosure of `AUTH_KEY` alone does not reveal captured past session traffic. Each side
computes an HMAC **tag** over its DH public key under a pre-shared `AUTH_KEY` that `relay` does
not have, and verifies the peer's tag before deriving any session key. `relay` still *attempts*
the identical key-substitution attack — same code path, same two-handshake structure — but
without `AUTH_KEY` it cannot forge a valid tag for the public keys it substitutes, so Alice's and
Bob's own verification fails and both abort. (Production systems typically authenticate DH with
signatures/certificates rather than a shared secret — TLS and SSH both do this — but the
principle demonstrated here, *authenticate the exchange, don't just run it*, is the same one.)

**What this lab does *not* show:** a small-subgroup attack or the consequences of skipping
public-key validation. Those are optional study topics. The running demo is specifically
the key-substitution MITM.

## Run it

Start Docker Desktop and wait for **Engine running**. Download the course ZIP from
<https://github.com/nutthakorn7/security-cryptography> (**Code → Download ZIP**)
and extract it, unless your existing Week 4 ZIP already has this lab. Open
`security-cryptography-master/labs/week05-key-exchanges` in File Explorer (Windows)
or Finder (Mac). On Windows, right-click empty space and choose **Open in Terminal**
(or Shift-right-click → **Open PowerShell window here**). On Mac, open Terminal,
type `cd `, drag the lab folder into Terminal, then press Enter. Check that `dir`
(Windows) or `ls` (Mac) lists both `docker-compose.vulnerable.yml` and
`docker-compose.fixed.yml`. Run every command below from that lab folder; no host
Python installation is needed. The worksheet has the full beginner checklist.

Vulnerable mode — full, invisible MITM:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.vulnerable.yml up --build
```
Expected log lines (interleaving/ports/IPs vary run to run — the container names and message
text do not):
```
week05-bob    | BOB: listening on 0.0.0.0:5000 (SIGNED=False)
week05-relay  | RELAY: listening on 0.0.0.0:5000, forwarding to bob:5000 (SIGNED=False)
week05-alice  | ALICE: connecting to relay:5000 (SIGNED=False)
week05-relay  | RELAY: completed independent DH handshake with Alice (posing as Bob)
week05-alice  | ALICE: sent encrypted message ('the launch code is 4471')
week05-relay  | RELAY: completed independent DH handshake with Bob (posing as Alice)
week05-relay  | RELAY INTERCEPTED: the launch code is 4471
week05-bob    | BOB RECEIVED: the launch code is 4471
```
Alice exits `0` once her message is sent; `bob` and `relay` are long-running servers — stop the
stack with `Ctrl-C` then tear it down:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.vulnerable.yml down
```

Fixed mode — HMAC-authenticated DH public keys:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.fixed.yml up --build
```
Expected log lines:
```
week05-bob    | BOB: listening on 0.0.0.0:5000 (SIGNED=True)
week05-relay  | RELAY: listening on 0.0.0.0:5000, forwarding to bob:5000 (SIGNED=True)
week05-alice  | ALICE: connecting to relay:5000 (SIGNED=True)
week05-relay  | RELAY: (fixed mode) attempted DH substitution with Alice (posing as Bob)
week05-alice  | AUTH FAILED - ABORTING
week05-relay  | RELAY: (fixed mode) attempted DH substitution with Bob (posing as Alice)
week05-bob    | AUTH FAILED - ABORTING
```
Both `alice` and `bob` exit `1`. There is **no** `RELAY INTERCEPTED` line anywhere in this mode's
logs — that absence is your evidence the fix worked. Tear down the same way:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.fixed.yml down
```

No environment variables need to be set by hand — which compose file you point `-f` at is the
*only* thing that selects vulnerable vs. fixed mode (`SIGNED`/`AUTH_KEY` are baked into each
file's `environment:` block). This deliberately avoids an earlier design bug an advisor review
caught: a single-file/`--profile` scheme where `--profile fixed` could silently still run
vulnerable behavior unless `SIGNED=1` was also exported by hand.

## Verified

Both modes were Docker-tested against the actual files in this directory, independently, twice:
once by the colleague who built this lab (`docker compose -f <file> up --build`, no env-var
overrides, run fresh from a scratchpad copy and torn down after) and once again while writing
this README (`docker compose -f <file> up --build --abort-on-container-exit`, run fresh from
this directory, `down` + images removed after each mode).

- **Vulnerable:** both runs printed `RELAY: completed independent DH handshake with Alice
  (posing as Bob)`, `RELAY: completed independent DH handshake with Bob (posing as Alice)`,
  `RELAY INTERCEPTED: the launch code is 4471`, and `BOB RECEIVED: the launch code is 4471`, in
  that relative order, with `alice` exiting `0`.
- **Fixed:** both runs printed `AUTH FAILED - ABORTING` from **both** `alice` and `bob` (exit
  code `1` each), `RELAY: (fixed mode) attempted DH substitution with Alice (posing as Bob)` and
  the matching line for Bob, and **zero** occurrences of `RELAY INTERCEPTED` — confirmed with
  `docker compose -f docker-compose.fixed.yml logs | grep -c "RELAY INTERCEPTED"` returning `0`
  on both runs (Mac/Linux Terminal). On Windows PowerShell, use
  `(docker compose -f docker-compose.fixed.yml logs | Select-String -SimpleMatch "RELAY INTERCEPTED" | Measure-Object).Count`.
- Both stacks were torn down (`docker compose down`) and their built images removed after
  verification; nothing was left running.

## Deliverable

Submit the common evidence and reasoning (60) plus only the assigned Conventional (40)
or AIR-Sec (40) format. The details below describe the common artifact; the worksheet
identifies the alternative sections.
Worksheet 5: shared log evidence and control/limitations explanation (common 60), plus
either four short Part 1 questions (Conventional 40) or Audit-the-AI, EiPE and Prompt
Problem tasks (AIR-Sec 20/10/10). Part 2d viva is formative/authenticity feedback.
